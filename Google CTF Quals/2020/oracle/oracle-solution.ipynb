    "AEGIS is an AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) cipher. The whole encryption process can be split into 4 phases: _initialization, authentication of associated data, plaintext encryption_ and _finalization_, as shown in [Figure 1](#fig-1). Inputs to the process are a key, an IV, a plaintext and some associated data that needs to be authenticated (but not encrypted). Outputs are the plaintext in encrypted form (ciphertext) and an authentication tag."

This state then transits for a number of times `t` (hence the initial state is denoted as `s[-t]`) using `ip[i]`(`i = 0,1,...t-1`), which are also derived from the key and the IV, as state transition parameters. The purpose of this phase is to make sure that the internal state after initialization `s[0]` looks like a random value, although partial information about the key and the IV may be known to attackers. Therefore, `k` will be chosen depends on how fast a change in the key or IV propagates inside the state for each transition."

The later was published first, but it was somehow mis-configured: In the second sub-challenge, for each oracle call, it returned, not just 1 byte of the plaintext, but the whole plaintext by sending back the UnicodeDecodeError object in pickle serialization format (the plaintext is one of its attributes), thus making the challenge easier to solve (at least, we don't need to bother with the limitation in the number of oracle calls). However, we still need to understand the attack in order to complete the challenge.\n",

    "This is a common lattice problem named [Closest vector problem (CVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Closest_vector_problem_.28CVP.29). In our situation, we need to find a linear combination with integer coefficients of those known column-vectors on the left-hand side, which results in a vector as close to $(0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_{21})$ as possible. The difference $(\\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_1, ..., \\epsilon_{21})$ is what we really want to get. Since knowing $\\epsilon_i$, calculating $t_i^{-1}(u_i + \\epsilon_i)$ would give us $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem above, we may use the LLL algorithm to reduce those column-vectors on the left to a \"better\" basis $B$ (which consists of short, nearly orthogonal vectors), temporarily ignore $(\\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_1, ..., \\epsilon_{21})$, solve for $x$ in the equation $Bx = c$ with $c = (0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_{21})$, and finally round each component of $x$ to its nearest integer to obtain $\\bar{x}$. The closest vector and the difference would be $B\\bar{x}$ and $B\\bar{x}-c$ respectively."

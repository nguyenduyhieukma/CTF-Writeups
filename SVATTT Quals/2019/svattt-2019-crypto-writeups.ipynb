    "This challenge requires basic knowledge about the RSA cryptosystem. The server allows us to sign (in textbook mode) only one message that ends with 0x2019 in hex-form but not `target = 0x63617420666c61672019` (\"cat flag\\x20\\x19\"), and asks us for the signature of `target`. Since the length of the message is not checked, we can feed the server with `m = target + n*256**2` which ends with 0x2019 and equals `target` modulo `n`, to obtain the signature of `target`."

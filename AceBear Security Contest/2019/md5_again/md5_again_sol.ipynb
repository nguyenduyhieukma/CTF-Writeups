    "## (Crypto challenge) _MD5 again?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge summary\n",
    "An improper implementation of MD5 was given and contestants were asked to reverse its state transition algorithm in order to forge arbitrary secret-prefix MACs without knowing the chunksize-long secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge files: [md5_again.py](resource/md5_again.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested solution\n",
    "Based on the pseudocode given at [MD5 wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Pseudocode), the missing part in the provided implementation in the challenge is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    //Add this chunk's hash to result so far:\n",
    "    a0 := a0 + A\n",
    "    b0 := b0 + B\n",
    "    c0 := c0 + C\n",
    "    d0 := d0 + D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the state transition is about to simply apply the main MD5 operation 64 times. The figure below describes one MD5 operation. Reversing it is not a hard task.\n",
    "\n",
    "![the MD5 operation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/MD5_algorithm.svg/300px-MD5_algorithm.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### P.S.\n",
    "A small change to a standard cryptography algorithm/protocol may cause you a lot of trouble."
